# Tower of Fantasy AHK Helper
This is a little macro I made because I wasn't satisfied with the other public macros.

## Features
1 - Auto Attack

2 - Auto Climb

3 - Auto Dodge

4 - Frigg Multislash

5 - Quick Interactive Map Toggle

and more to come if I can be bothered.

There are a few bugs that I want to get fixed but this is v1.0 so it's "fine" as it is. DM me on discord if you have anything you'd like to see added, I'll try get around to it if it's something interesting.

You can change your binds for everything in settings.ini, its currently using my settings as default. For browser you want to do whatever your browser adds to the end of webpage titles, e.g. Youtube "- Google", Youtube "- Brave". For map title you put the full title it shows, default being Tower of Fantasy Interactive Map - Brave because its the map I use and brave is the browser I use. Map link is self explanatory, just put the link to the interactive map you use (although I'd recommend using the map I use)
